# We need a mechanism wherein the developers can push their code into an SCM (Source Code Management) repository and view/approve each other’s changes before executing terraform. Git allows for full collaborative workflows; hence, we’ll look at two different methods using GitHub and GitHub Actions. We can enable collaboration between developers by taking
 # away their responsibility of manually executing terraform commands from CLI by leveraging the VCS driven-workflow and the Terraform API- driven workflow provided by Terraform Cloud, thus automating the entire terraform workflow. We’ll also finally look at the drawbacks of using the VCS workflow and why GitHub Actions is a preferable setup.*]

 # main.tf - Primary file implementing all the terraform code
output.tf - Stores all output definitions
providers.tf - Stores all provider configurations
terraform.auto.tfvars - Stores values of all variable definitions
variables.tf - Stores all variable definitions.
